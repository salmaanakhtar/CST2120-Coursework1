        <h1>Rules</h1>
        <p>Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a checkered board with 64 squares arranged in an 8Ã—8 grid. The game is played by millions of people worldwide. Each player begins with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. Each of the six piece types moves differently, with the most powerful being the queen and the least powerful the pawn. The objective is to checkmate the opponent's king by placing it under an inescapable threat of capture. To this end, a player's pieces are used to attack and capture the opponent's pieces, while supporting each other.</p>
        <p>There are six different types of pieces in chess, each with its own unique way of moving. Here are the six types of pieces:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>King</li>
            <li>Queen</li>
            <li>Rook</li>
            <li>Bishop</li>
            <li>Knight</li>
            <li>Pawn</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each piece has its own unique way of moving. The king moves one square in any direction. The queen moves any number of squares in any direction. The rook moves any number of squares horizontally or vertically. The bishop moves any number of squares diagonally. The knight moves in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and one square in a perpendicular direction. The pawn moves forward one square, but captures diagonally.</p>
        <p>There are also special moves in chess, such as castling and en passant. Castling is a move involving the king and either of the original rooks of the same color. En passant is a move in which a pawn can capture an opponent's pawn if it moves two squares forward from its starting position and lands next to the opponent's pawn.</p>
        <p>These are just a few of the basic rules of chess. The game has a rich history and many variations, but the basic rules remain the same. Chess is a game of strategy, skill, and patience, and is enjoyed by players of all ages and skill levels.</p>
